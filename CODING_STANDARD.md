# Coding Standard for Ásbru

## Coding guide lines

* Use spaces as indentation 4 Spaces per indentation level.
* No trailing white spaces if possible.
* Explicit if statements.
  - No use  of:
    - `unless`
    - reversed if `next if $true;`
    - non explicit conditional expressions
      - `($a) && ($b) and print "do this if both variables are true";`
* Use of strings with interpolation.
  - Example: `$CNF_DIR = "$ENV{'HOME'}/.config/pac";`
* Nested parenthesis should be together unless you feel that a separation makes code more readable.
* All conditional blocks, Loops must be on different lines, even if it is one statement in the block.
* Local variables should be declared at the beginning of a function block, and if they are not initialized, they could be declared as one line.
    * `my ($var1, $var2, $var3);`
    * Avoid declaring them in the middle of the block, unless is going to be used as a temporary variable inside an inner block.
* Rules might be bent from time to time, when brings something valuable to the code over formatting.

## Documentation guide lines

* At the end of each script the `__END__` marker should be added
  - This marker will tell the compiler to stop processing the file from that point onward.
  - Allowing to write extensive documentation without being processed by the compiler.
* After the end marker, documentation can be added in pod format, to allow perldoc to format and present information on the screen or to export to other formats.

### Basic pod (Plain Old Documentation)

**Common Sections**, as found in all CPAN documentation

* **NAME** module or script name, a dash and a short description.
* SYNOPSIS shows example usage.
* **DESCRIPTION** long description of what the module does and lists functions.
* **BUGS or CAVEATS** about bugs or issues the user should know about.
* ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS thank bug fixers, testers and your parents.
* COPYRIGHT or LICENSE copyright restrictions.
* AVAILABILITY Where to download from
* AUTHOR who made it.

The bold sections should be the minimum to Document. Other sections already exist in the repository or could not apply to this particular project.

### Pod markup summary

**This is a reduced set**, if anyone is interested on the full description, follow this reference: https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html

```pod
=encoding utf8

=head1 NAME

There are 4 header level 1..4

Pod will indent each section,
as in many markup languages, two or more lines together are printed as a single line.

=head2

Always leave a blank line before and after each pod tag,
log lines can be split into consecutive lines.

Indent one level with a tab to document code and create a verbatim sections where each line is printed separately.

    sub myFunction {
        print "Something";
    }

```

Basic styles not all available in terminal
```pod
B<bold text>
I<Italic text, shown as underline text in terminal>
C<code text>
B<tags can be I<nested>>
```

**Example pod file in asbru-cm**

```
__END___
=encoding utf8

=head1 NAME

asbru-cm

=head1 SYNOPSYS

asbru-cm [options]

B<Options>

    --help : show this message
    --no-backup : do no create alternative config files as a backup (faster shutdown)
    --start-shell : start a local terminal
    --password=<pwd> : automatically logon with given password without prompting user
    --start-uuid=<uuid>[:<cluster] : start connection in cluster (if given)
    --edit-uuid=<uuid> : edit connection
    --dump-uuid=<uuid> : dump data for given connection
    --scripts : open scripts window
    --start-script=<script> : start given script
    --preferences : open global preferences dialog
    --quick-conn : open the Quick Connect dialog on startup
    --list-uuids : list existing connections/groups and their UUIDs
    --no-splash : no splash screen on startup
    --iconified : go to tray once started
    --readonly : start in read only mode (no config changes allowed)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Global Variables

I<$CFG_DIR>    Setup your configuration directory here.

You may run different versions of Ásbru and each have different configuration settings and connections.

=head2 Functions

C<sub config_migration> (no parameters) (no return values)

Function normally empty unless there is a migration of the configuration files.

```

**See result executing** `perldoc asbru-cm`

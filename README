* PAC (Perl Auto Connector), by David Torrejon Vaquerizas (david.tv@gmail.com), is FREE software, released under GNU's GPLv3 license.

* PAC is a SecureCRT/Putty/etc (connections manager with automations) equivalent for the Linux world.

* FEATURES (by now):

	- Simple GUI to manage/launch connections to remote machines.
	- Scripting possibilities, 'ala' SecureCRT
	- Configurable [Pre|Post]-connection local commands execution.
	- Configurable list of macros (commands) to execute locally when connected or to send to connected client.
	- Configurable list of conditional executions on connected machine via 'Expect':
		. forget about SSH certificates
		. chain multiple ssh connections
		. automate tunnels creation
		. with line-send delay capabilities!! etc...
	- KeePassX integration!
	- Ability to connect to machines through a Proxy server!
	- CLUSTER connections.
	- TABBED/WINDOWED terminals
	- Wake On LAN capabilities
	- Local and Global variables, eg.: write down a password once, use it ANY where, centralizing its modification for faster changes! use them for:
		. password vault
		. reusing connection strings
	- Seamless Gnome/Gtk integration.
	- Tray icon for 'right button' quick launching of managed connections. Screenshots and statistics!
	- DEB, RPM and .TAR.GZ packages available
	- Written in Perl/Gtk (wait, *is* that a feature? Well, it is for me! ;=)
	- It is FREE (as in freedom)!! and licensed under GNU GPLv3.

* INSTALL:

	- Preferably, use "deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu <your_distrib_name>-getdeb apps", but if you can/want not to use it, simply download the corresponding package from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/pacmanager" for your system and install it.

	- Now you can take a look at your Gnome's menu under "Applications" -> "Internet" -> "PAC", or type "pac" in your terminal.

* KNOWN BUGS:

	- Find them for yourself... ;)

* EASTER EGGS:

	- For sure!!! Just figure out the 'Kode' and 'place' to be used! ;)

* QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

	Q: Why did you started programming this 'little monster'? Could you not simply use *ssh in a terminal*, or *putty for linux*? Eh? Couldn't you?
	A: Hell! NO!! Just take a look at PAC and *tell me* whether you find or not these features in any other piece of Linux software!
		And yes, I wanted a GUI to manage my 'zillion' of connections to administrate servers in my IT job.
		And that GUI should be nice/quick enough as to be usable, and I think I got it! Just let me know!
		(Really: it is 'priceless' to have an intuitive GUI that helps you start with a simple click from the systray a connections that ssh's to one machine, autologins, executes something, then ssh's from that machine to another, autologin again, and finally brings a third machine remote ports locally to my laptop)

	Q: Why 'PAC'? It sounds terribly awful and... welll... it sucks!!
	A: You are in reason. In fact, you *should* propose me a *better* name for it...

	Q: Why in the world is this piece of cr*p (I mean, 'software') written in Perl language? Is not there any uglier/older/unfashinable language?
	A: I'm glad you ask so. Perl is the only language I know. And I like it.
		And you *should* like it too. You ALL should give *love* to this adorable language by Larry Wall.
		Oh, and no, there is no older or uglier or what-ever-you-ask-for language to program with.

	Q: Your programming style sucks! When are you gonna learn to program like human beings?
	A: Since I do not think of myself as a human being, I do not feel the necesity to learn such a thing (despite I know for sure *that* would be great!)

	Q: For God's love, I really hate you and the way you program!
	A: That's not a question, but anyway, I do also hate MY programming style
		(believe me, now I am slacking my face and pressing my nipples strongly in order to punish myself for being such a bad programmer! ;)

	Q: Anyway, now that I'm used to it, I'm wondering how *often* will you upload new versions. Could you tell me, please?
	A: Well, you know, I AM 'too old', 'too married' and 'too father' as to have *enough* time as to be modifying PAC every day, so... well...mmm...
		NO IDEA!

	Q: Oohh... so many questions...  why 'YAML', why 'Gnome2:Vte', why...???
	A: Blah blah blah... shut the f**k up and simply use it if you dare!! ;)

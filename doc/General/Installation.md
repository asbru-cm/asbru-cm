# Testing new features

Our master and the snapshots are being kept as stable as possible. New features for new major releases are being developed inside the "loki" branch.

Beware that [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki) can sometimes behave in an unexpected manner to you.  This is somehow the same concept as the "[Debian sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/)" release.

You are welcome to contribute and test by checking out "loki" or by installing our builds.

#### Gnome2::Vte

0) The VTE dev package is required to get Gnome2::Vte compiled for your environment

    ````
    $ sudo apt install libvte-dev
    ````

1) Start CPAN shell

    ````
    $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
    ````

2) The very fist time you start CPAN, it will ask you some questions.  Please chose the best option for your environement, in this example, we will assume the following choices:

    ````
    Would you like to configure as much as possible automatically?   --> yes
    What approach do you want?   --> sudo
    ````

3) In the CPAN shell, install Gnome2::Vte

    ````
    cpan[1] > install Gnome2::Vte
    ````

    This will download the latest version (0.11), compile it and install it under /usr/local/lib.

4) Cleaning up:

    (those steps are optional, think carefully about your own environment !  This may potentially break your system. **You have been warned**)

    If you don't need the development packages anymore:

    ````
    $ sudo apt purge libvte-dev
    $ sudo apt autoremove
    ````

    If it was the first time you used CPAN and you don't want to keep .cpan configuration, sources, etc.

    ````
    $ rm -rf .cpan
    ````

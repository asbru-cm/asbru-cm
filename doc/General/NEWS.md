Dear testers,

We have merged the codebase for version 6.1.0 into master. This release will bring some cleanups and a few new features which require testing.

These new features are:

* Support for SOCKS Proxy (for VNC/RDP/SSH/SFTP today) using [ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) for advanced cases
* Support for Jump Host to simplify SSH tunneling for VNC/RDP/SSH connections.

We would be happy if you can test the master snapshots as we would like to release the first official *rc1* build soon.

Attention: please make sure you have a safe copy of your configuration directory (which is ~/.config/pac) by default before proceeding with your tests.

Thanks and happy testing.

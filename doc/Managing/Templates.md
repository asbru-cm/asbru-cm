## Existing Connections are Templates

+ Click on any existing connection that has the most similar configuration that you need.
+ `<Ctrl-D>` or right click `Clone`.
+ Edit the new cloned connection and adjust to your new conditions.
+ If the connection has to be available in a different group.
  - `<Ctrl-X>` Cut the connection node.
  - Click on group where you want the new node to be.
  - `<Ctrl-V>` paste the node in the new location.

## Creating Templates Group

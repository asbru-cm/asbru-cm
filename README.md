### Installation

We recommend installing Ásbrú Connection Manager using our latest pre-built packages hosted on [cloudsmith.io](https://cloudsmith.io/).

To do so, execute the following commands:

- Debian / Ubuntu

  ````
  curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/asbru-cm/release/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
  sudo apt-get install asbru-cm
  ````

- Fedora

  ````
  curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/asbru-cm/release/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
  sudo dnf install asbru-cm
  ````

- Pacman-based (e.g. Arch Linux, Manjaro)

  ````
  git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/asbru-cm-git.git && cd asbru-cm-git
  makepkg -si
  ````
  
- MX Linux

  Ásbrú Connection Manager can be installed through the MX Package Installer under the Test Repo tab
  or by enabling the Test Repo and running
  ````
  sudo apt-get install asbru-cm
  ````
  
- Windows

  - Windows 10 Build 19044 and later, or Windows 11
 
    See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps

    tl;dr:
    
    1. Install or update WSL.
    2. Follow the installation instructions for Ubuntu above.
    3. Ásbrú Connection Manager will then be available in the start menu.

  - Windows 10 before Build 19044, or running older WSL

    It is possible to run Asbru-CM on Windows 10 by enabling WSL and using the application [Asbru-CM Runner](https://github.com/SegiH/Asbru-CM-Runner). If you do not have [WSLG](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg) support, you will need to install [Xming](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/). The GitHub page for [Asbru-CM Runner](https://github.com/SegiH/Asbru-CM-Runner) has detailed instructions on how to do this and allows you to run Asbru-CM on Windows 10 without a console window open in the background.
  
Once installed on your system, type ````asbru-cm```` in your terminal.

### Testing new features

Our master and the snapshots are being kept as stable as possible. New features for new major releases are being developed inside the "loki" branch.

Beware that [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki) can sometimes behave in an unexpected manner to you.  This is somehow the same concept as the "[Debian sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/)" release.

You are welcome to contribute and test by checking out "loki" or by installing our builds.

If you do not wish to run third party scripts on your systems, you can always access manual install instructions at https://cloudsmith.io/~asbru-cm/repos/loki/setup/

- Debian / Ubuntu

  ````
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/asbru-cm/loki/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
  ````

- Fedora

  ````
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/asbru-cm/loki/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash

### Frequenty Asked Questions

- Why did you call that project "Ásbrú" ?

  In Norse mythology, [Ásbrú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st) refers to a burning rainbow bridge that connects Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the gods.

- Is this a fork of PAC (Perl Auto Connector) Manager ?

  Yes.

  As [David Torrejon Vaquerizas](https://github.com/perseo22), the author of PAC Manager, could not find time, for some reasons that we respect, to continue the work on his project and was not open for external contributions ([see this](https://github.com/perseo22/pacmanager/issues/57)), a fork was needed to ensure the future and give the opportunity to the community to take over.

More questions can be found on the [dedicated project wiki page](https://github.com/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).

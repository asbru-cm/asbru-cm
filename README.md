  ````
  $ curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/asbru-cm/gtk3/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
  $ sudo apt-get install asbru-cm

### Frequenty Asked Questions

- Why did you call that project "Ásbrú" ?

  In Norse mythology, [Ásbrú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st) refers to a burning rainbow bridge that connects Midgard (Earth) and Asgard, the realm of the gods.

- Is this a fork of PAC (Perl Auto Connector) Manager ?

  Yes.

  As [David Torrejon Vaquerizas](https://github.com/perseo22), the author of PAC Manager, could not find time, for some reasons that we respect, to continue the work on his project and was not open for external contributions ([see this](https://github.com/perseo22/pacmanager/issues/57)), a fork was needed to ensure the future and give the opportunity to the community to take over.

More questions can be found on the [dedicated project wiki page](https://github.com/asbru-cm/asbru-cm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions).
